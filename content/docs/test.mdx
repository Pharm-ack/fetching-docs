## Server-Side Data Fetching

Thanks to Nextjs cause all pages in Nextjs is a server component by default unless you use "use client" directive which will turn the page into client component.

So to fetch data on the server side, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file in folder/working directories, e.g., `app/job/jobs.ts`
2. Import the necessary dependencies:

### Note:

> So when it comes to this dependencies, it depends on the endpoint you are hitting. If the endpoint needs an access_token we will need to import a dependency from NextAuth in other for us to grap the access_token being saved in the cookies, then insert it in the header of the request we are making. Stll more Talk on this..

3. Create an async function to fetch the data

```ts
"use server";

export const fetchJobs = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${process.env.API_URL}/api/v1/jobs`,
     ,
      {
        method: "GET",
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
      },
    );

    if (!response.ok) {
      console.error("Network response was not ok:", response);
      throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
    }
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(Received data:, data);
    return data.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error in fetchWaitlistUsers:", error);
    throw error;
  }
};

```

In the above code you will noticed I use couple of things there which is:

1. "use server" directive
2. process.env.API_URL
